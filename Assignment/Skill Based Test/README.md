### Question 1

You are required to write a client program (any programming language) that connect to izani.synology.me at port 8443.

Once connected, send your UiTM Student ID to the server and read the server response. A unique URL will be generated where your next question and further instruction will be. 

For the coding, you can see [here](https://github.com/6D756E6972/ITT440-Network-Programming/tree/main/Assignment/Skill%20Based%20Test/Question%201)

and from here, i can continue the test ðŸ˜„

### Question 2

You are required to create client-server program in C programming language for random number.  You may choose either tcp or udp transmission protocol.
