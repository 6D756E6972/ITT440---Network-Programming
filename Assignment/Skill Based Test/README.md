Name:  NIK BADRUL MUNIR BIN NIK SAHAZEMAN

Student ID:  2021619382

Group:  CS2554A <sub>

Due date : Friday, 21 July 2023

### Question 1

You are required to write a client program (any programming language) that connect to izani.synology.me at port 8443.

Once connected, send your UiTM Student ID to the server and read the server response. A unique URL will be generated where your next question and further instruction will be. 

For the coding, you can see [here](https://github.com/6D756E6972/ITT440-Network-Programming/tree/main/Assignment/Skill%20Based%20Test/Question%201)

and this will be the output

and from here, i can continue the test ðŸ˜„

### Question 2

You are required to create client-server program in C programming language for random number.  You may choose either tcp or udp transmission protocol.

a) Write a server program to pass one random number ranging from 100 to 999.

b) Write a client program to retrieve random number from server and display it accordingly.

[here](https://github.com/6D756E6972/ITT440-Network-Programming/tree/main/Assignment/Skill%20Based%20Test/Question%202) is the provided code.

and the output on the server will be:

and at the client will be:

### Question 3

You are required to create client-server program in Python programming language for pressure conversion.  You may choose either tcp or udp transmission protocol.

a) Write a server program that will convert received pressure in bar to atmosphere-standard.

b) Write a client program to get user input pressure value in bar and display received atmosphere-standard value from server.  Display it accordingly.

There is no pressure writing [this](https://github.com/6D756E6972/ITT440-Network-Programming/tree/main/Assignment/Skill%20Based%20Test/Question%203) code.

The server will output this:
